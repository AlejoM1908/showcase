These illusions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as light and shadow, color, patterns, and depth perception.
Our eyes gather information about the world around us and send signals to our brain to interpret that information. However, sometimes our brain interprets that information in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t match reality.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/Workshops/-Illusions-Masking/masking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/Workshops/-Illusions-Masking/masking/</guid><description>Images Masking # Kernel masking, also known as convolution masking, is a technique used in image processing to apply a specific filter or kernel to an image. This technique involves sliding a small matrix, known as a kernel or filter, over the entire image and performing a mathematical operation at each pixel location. The resulting output image is a new image that has been transformed based on the filter&amp;rsquo;s characteristics.</description></item></channel></rss>
