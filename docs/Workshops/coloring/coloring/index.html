<label for=toc-control></label></div></header><article class=markdown><h1 id=hsl-color-mode>HSL Color Mode
<a class=anchor href=#hsl-color-mode>#</a></h1><p>HSL Color Mode is a way of representing colors in terms of three properties: hue, saturation and lightness. HSL Color Mode is based on the concept of the color wheel, where colors are arranged in a circle according to their hue. Hue is measured in degrees, with red at 0°, green at 120° and blue at 240° and all other hues arranged between the three primary colors.</p><p>Saturation is a measure of how intense or pure a color is and is expressed as a percentage from 0% (fully desaturated) to 100% (fully saturated). In HSL Color Mode a fully saturated color has no white, gray or black added while a desaturated color has some amount of white, gray or black added.</p><p>Lightness refers to how bright a color is and is also expressed as a percentage from 0% (completely black) to 100% (completely white). In HSL Color Mode luminosity is distinct from saturation which allows a color to be highly saturated and highly luminous at the same time (such as a bright neon color) or highly desaturated and dark (such as a dull dark color).</p><p>One of the advantages of using HSL Color Mode is that it allows greater flexibility and control over color choice since the hue, saturation and lightness values can be adjusted independently of each other. For example, if there is a color you like, but you want to make it lighter or darker you can adjust the lightness values without changing the hue and saturation.</p><p>Overall HSL Color Mode is a powerful tool for working with color whether you are designing graphics, creating artwork or building a website. By understanding how the three properties hue, saturation and lightness relate to each other you can create an almost unlimited amount of colors and achieve the desired visual effect.</p><h1 id=hsb-color-mode>HSB Color Mode
<a class=anchor href=#hsb-color-mode>#</a></h1><p>HSB Color Mode is another way to represent colors using three values: Hue, Saturation, and Brightness. HSB stands for Hue, Saturation, and Brightness and is sometimes also called HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value).</p><p>In HSB Color Mode hue is still represented by a color wheel where colors are arranged in a circle according to their hue angle. Hue is measured in degrees, with red at 0°, green at 120° and blue at 240° and all other hues arranged between the three primary colors.</p><p>Saturation is again a measure of how intense or pure a color is and is expressed as a percentage from 0% (fully desaturated) to 100% (fully saturated). In HSB Color Mode a fully saturated color has no white, gray or black added while a desaturated color has some amount of white, gray or black added.</p><p>The third property in HSB Color Mode is brightness which represents the amount of light reflected by a color, also expressed as a percentage from 0% (completely black) to 100% (completely white). In HSB Color Mode brightness is distinct from saturation which allows a color to be either highly saturated and bright at the same time or highly desaturated and dark.</p><p>An advantage of using HSB Color Mode is that it can be more intuitive for many users as it corresponds more closely to the way people perceive and describe color. For example, when we speak of a &ldquo;bright&rdquo; or &ldquo;dark&rdquo; color, we refer to the brightness of the color that is most directly represented in HSB Color Mode.</p><h1 id=rgb-color-mode>RGB Color Mode
<a class=anchor href=#rgb-color-mode>#</a></h1><p>RGB Color Mode is a way of representing colors on digital devices such as monitors, televisions and mobile devices. RGB stands for Red, Green, and Blue (Red, Green, and Blue) the primary colors of light that combine to create the other colors in this mode.</p><p>In RGB Color Mode each color is represented by a combination of three values representing the intensity of red, green and blue required to create the color. These values are typically expressed as numbers from 0 to 255 where 0 represents zero intensity and 255 represents full intensity.</p><p>RGB Color Mode is widely used in digital design, web design and other digital applications. It is a powerful tool for creating a wide range of colors and achieving accurate color matching, but it has its limitations such as the fact that it may not accurately represent the colors of printed materials that usually use a different color mode.</p><h2 id=example>Example
