It works by defining a color based on its hue, which is its position on the color wheel, its saturation, which is its intensity or purity, and its lightness, which is its brightness or darkness. In the HSL model, the hue value represents the color itself, while the saturation and lightness values determine how vivid and bright or dull and dark the color appears.</description></item></channel></rss>
