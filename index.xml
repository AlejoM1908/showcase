These illusions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as light and shadow, color, patterns, and depth perception.
Our eyes gather information about the world around us and send signals to our brain to interpret that information. However, sometimes our brain interprets that information in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t match reality.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/Workshops/-Illusions-Masking/masking/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/Workshops/-Illusions-Masking/masking/</guid><description>Images Masking # Kernel masking, also known as convolution masking, is a technique used in image processing to apply a specific filter or kernel to an image. This technique involves sliding a small matrix, known as a kernel or filter, over the entire image and performing a mathematical operation at each pixel location. The resulting output image is a new image that has been transformed based on the filter&amp;rsquo;s characteristics.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/Workshops/coloring/coloring/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/Workshops/coloring/coloring/</guid><description>HSL Color Mode # HSL Color Mode is a way of representing colors in terms of three properties: hue, saturation and lightness. HSL Color Mode is based on the concept of the color wheel, where colors are arranged in a circle according to their hue. Hue is measured in degrees, with red at 0°, green at 120° and blue at 240° and all other hues arranged between the three primary colors.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/Workshops/terrain_generation/mach_bands/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/Workshops/terrain_generation/mach_bands/</guid><description>Terrain with Perlin Noise # Perlin Noise is used here to represent the &amp;ldquo;natural&amp;rdquo; change in incerted triangles in a plane
Perlin Noise # Perlin Noise is a type of procedural noise function, meaning that it generates random values in a way that looks natural and organic. It was invented by Ken Perlin in 1983 for use in computer graphics.
Perlin Noise generates a grid of values, where each grid point is assigned a random value.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/About-Us/Alejandro_Melo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/About-Us/Alejandro_Melo/</guid><description>Daniel Alejandro Melo Nuvan # About me # Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Daniel Alejandro Melo Nuvan, I&amp;rsquo;m a Software Engineer with 1 and a half year of experience with Backend technologies like Docker, NodeJS, Django, Mysql, MongoDb, and many other. As a thechnofile i&amp;rsquo;m always willing to learn new technologies and improve my skills in as many fields as possible, and the optimization thechniques that are required for the visual computing field are a great challenge for me.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/About-Us/David_Cifuentes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://visualcomputing.github.io/showcase/docs/About-Us/David_Cifuentes/</guid><description> David Alejandro Cifuentes Gonzalez # I&amp;rsquo;m a Systems engenering student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia, I&amp;rsquo;m from Bogota-Colombia and I&amp;rsquo;m currently coursing the sixth semester of the carrer
