Post-effect refers to any modifications or enhancements applied to an image after it has been captured or rendered. These effects are typically applied using image editing software or tools.

Post-effects can be used to alter the overall appearance of an image, enhance certain aspects, or create specific artistic or stylistic effects. They allow photographers and designers to add creative touches, adjust colors, tones, contrast, or apply various filters and effects to achieve the desired look.


## Black and White

The black and white filter works by converting a color image into a grayscale image, which means that each pixel in the resulting image will have a single intensity value representing the shade of gray.

The grayscale values range from 0 (black) to 255 (white), representing the different shades of gray.
The resulting image can be displayed or saved for further use. By removing the color information and representing the image in shades of gray, the black and white filter can highlight the tonal values, textures, and overall composition of the image.

## Blur 
The blur effect, also known as Gaussian blur, is a common image filtering technique used to reduce image noise and create a smoother appearance by averaging the pixel values within a neighborhood. The blur effect helps to reduce high-frequency noise and remove fine details, resulting in a softer appearance. The amount of blur can be controlled by adjusting the kernel size or the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution.

## Hight contrast

Contrast refers to the difference in brightness or color between the light and dark areas of an image. The contrast filter adjusts the range of tones in an image to make it appear more vibrant or dynamic. Increasing the contrast makes the bright areas of the image appear brighter and the dark areas appear darker, enhancing the overall separation between light and dark elements. This can make the image look more vivid and visually appealing.

Decreasing the contrast reduces the difference between light and dark areas, resulting in a flatter and less vibrant image.

It's important to note that extreme adjustments to contrast may lead to loss of detail or overexposure in bright areas or underexposure in dark areas. Therefore, it's often desirable to apply contrast adjustments in moderation, keeping the overall visual balance in mind.

## Sepia

The sepia effect is a popular image filter that gives photos a warm, nostalgic, and vintage look, reminiscent of old photographs. It transforms a color image into a monochrome image with a brownish tone.The sepia effect mimics the look of older photographs, which were often tinted with brownish hues due to the aging of the photo paper and chemical processes used in the past.

## Viggneta 

The vignette effect is a popular image filter that darkens or fades the edges of an image, creating a gradual transition towards the center. This effect draws attention to the central subject of the image and can create a more dramatic or vintage look. The vignette effect gradually darkens or fades the edges of the image, drawing the viewer's focus towards the center. This can help create a more focused and dramatic composition or add a vintage aesthetic to the image.
