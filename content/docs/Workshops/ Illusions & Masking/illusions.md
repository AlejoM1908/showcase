## Optical Illusions

Optical illusions are phenomena where our eyes and brain perceive things differently than they actually are in reality. These illusions can be caused by a variety of factors, such as light and shadow, color, patterns, and depth perception.

Our eyes gather information about the world around us and send signals to our brain to interpret that information. However, sometimes our brain interprets that information in a way that doesn't match reality. This can happen because our brains use past experiences and knowledge to make sense of what we see, and always tries to consume as little energy as possible chossing the easiest interpretation of every image.

Sometimes they can be both fascinating and puzzling, generally used in art and architecture design to create interesting effects, but also in science to study the human brain and how it processes information from the environment and the amazing capabilities of facial recognition and depth perception.

### Illusions classification
{{< tabs "uniqueid" >}}
{{< tab "Geometric" >}}
## Geometric Illusions
These kind of illusions use simple geometric shapes to create distorsions in the perception of the viewer. They are usually caused by the way our brain interprets the information from our eyes, and the way our eyes gather information from the world around us.

Some of the most common geometric illusions are the following:
- [Muller-Lyer Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller%E2%80%93Lyer_illusion)
- [Ebbinghaus Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebbinghaus_illusion)
- [Hermann Grid Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grid_illusion)
- [Rubin's Vase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin%27s_vase)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Ambiguous" >}}
## Ambiguous Illusions
These kind of illusions can have multiple interpretations, and the viewer can see different things depending on their past experiences and knowledge. Our brain gets confused and can't decide what to see, so it chooses the easiest interpretation, which is usually the one that makes more sense to the viewer.

Some of the most common ambiguous illusions are the following:
- [Rubin's Vase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin%27s_vase)
- [Duck-Rabbit Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbit%E2%80%93duck_illusion)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "color" >}}
## Color Illusions
These kind of illusions use color to create distorsions in the perception of the viewer. Generally the color gradients are the ones that cause the most confusion, and the viewer can see different colors depending on the background color.

Some of the most common color illusions are the following:
- [Corsweet Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornsweet_illusion)
- [Color induction](http://www.psy.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/90901500585.pdf)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Motion" >}}
## Motion Illusions
These kind of illusions use motion to create distorsions in the perception of the viewer. Generally the viewer can see different things depending on the direction of the movement, and the speed of the movement.

Some of the most common motion illusions are the following:
- [Phi Phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phi_phenomenon)
- [Rotating Snakes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_snakes)
- [Waterfall Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_illusion)
- [Beta movement illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_movement)

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab "Tactile" >}}
## Tactile Illusions
These kind of illusions use touch to create distorsions in the perception of the viewer. Generally the viewer can see different things depending on the texture of the object, and the way the object is placed.

Some of the most common tactile illusions are the following:
- [Ruber Hand Illusion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_transfer_illusion)
- [Thermal Grid Illusion](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/280203/1-s2.0-S1877050915X00378/1-s2.0-S1877050915036492/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEHoaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQDYvedub8sQU1IwNUZVp%2BC2lIEYJwL3s2Z8sgeOY%2BH3hAIgNY%2BPMFIjZkd5Qgej6DU1SyYpxTsVAeDEYHtCdjf1KBYqsQUIUxAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDFaI%2FQo2k5NSGvLrVSqOBXfAlFoEa6G7Pyetf0oOFNAsKzuiPCJFlXkWxp1jypyk8eMvmhrO4vcP46Dmhww3e76IBcUa9QZk0XH9DA3V%2F7IjkYIXoS6ywzrpX7RJiWXE6JG1A9ZkbxXPPoh7T7gliKtwpr95iq215EPDc%2Bm6FZE1YuXxy5ZwE2MuVxY07L5yOTdTy3EHX3lIJdubHtR7tJWqHyWAVuCRywG51MYaXbtc0bXXHUsTytiB7gsGS%2Bsfmfo6qa4UZXXKDgwizof35liS%2FzYLzSJeaVusZ%2Fp3XRTcwgwt8UcwLJdoyK74Z8eI4Z9PD6H8zvWQ8PA%2BxxNvxqjaVhPhZdy%2FCg8sSFzmfsBfruxVsnauIAINtcD0wm%2Fl3kOEdRWI%2BzRRBCRwYcgVKCNBp9twYkBR1iIGGmd68vc4g7xeocfGy%2B%2BLuc9APFnwtjSdDG96EcNofgVxajNra2DMwo9oHYi%2B4XWMs13zFOuee%2FA%2FQpf2ioznyI74kBU6gX2OieBZPCBOd9ZKHkfpprbb0bQBIQTImiHstCwI%2FBEPvtwSVFqG7eArGCHO4%2F9LzJ3HH5rfaSaNZHTiikAJe9GCa%2BA7vMDDUSz0VTHSbc232TTlbW46tJON%2BxE3IsmpmJNp%2F6PV42iHXyjP1IOmJ2vXHPrquI0TKJYK5FZlSKR9IEoAibIZNUNx%2Fqc%2BNHYlf1fgE1%2Fc1FwdUuHHGSaw1Ni8M0jgol0Bn10BcoPVap9zWqMOOgU6WjyaeHE%2BuTNKtr2DZoa%2BtJgf%2Bzf2JLcDlnuj0xKQ7lfBjxAPNGSRPx%2Fy3EJQE2VERX%2BIk1bKieb3LnuY5gjMayXgoo0WBvCZ1Ku94TTMO0BFZX8jCNG0wYImRMoJB%2FCLAESvteN%2FyDDitY6hBjqxAaSR0gCTLzWIi1y5lfjHjhpSs1pj15NoT2o8dpH%2B%2FZJiGOvYDlUEjXfvFIESysOb3z75Q%2BaNTb%2Bo5dlBiTqiCXRA6M4aO6QMYpCGQnASS8h2i6VfuVictAu4cXXYPP4jS3Pq29Weo4rdfyxZa0HZscokfWdSD%2BVFOOHqv0%2B7CkIfrtwQZ9ShB23XhZs9q5bVVu4lcpgYQCpfmhTHSijxt7Ba8iQ25vRxV7vuz%2FZAA4BMTg%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20230329T024635Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY4WYVTPL6%2F20230329%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=dc190dc8f986be5df4b70f20e63276af3c5ff646af0d419d59fec01e9e8c6b05&hash=6522f7e4a4d288159734ed10e5d8f0dae2535d17dabe8ee09556ecaa7cc7d07f&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1877050915036492&tid=spdf-3a04cea4-5a2a-43b8-aeee-812a2e281f51&sid=92bbbe4955f65946326af17-aeb502e54207gxrqa&type=client&tsoh=d3d3LnNjaWVuY2VkaXJlY3QuY29t&ua=1909590102500d5e5a5c05&rr=7af4c888de603eeb&cc=co)

### Rainbow circles illusion

The following optical illusion, that can be classified as a motion and color illusion, works by overstimulating the visual systems of the brain, it consists of 3 main parts:

- The main circle color rings that hold a color gradient.
- An inner circle ring displaced a few degrees to the left.
- An outer circle ring displaced a few degrees to the right.

Without the inner and outer rings the illusion disappears, these generate the sensation of movement in the viewer and allow them to distort the circles, below a small demonstration of this phenomenon:

{{< details "Special Keys" >}}
| Key              | Description    |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| F                | Remove rings   |
| G                | Remove fill    |
{{< /details >}}

{{<p5-iframe ver="1.4.2" sketch="/showcase/sketches/rainbow_circles.js" width="550" height="400" marginHeight="0" marginWidth="0" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no">}}

#### Code explanation
For the implementation of the code, we generate a general function that draws any given circle arc in a given position.

{{< details "circle drawing">}}
```js
function drawCircle(stroke, size, hueArray, inverted, posX, posY) {
    push();
    strokeWeight(stroke);
    translate(posX, posY);
    rotate(frameCount * 0.32);

    // Primary Circle ring
    let colors = setColorsArray(hueArray, 0, inverted);
    setConicGradient(0, 0, 0, colors);
    if (!showEdges) ellipse(0, 0, size, size);

    strokeWeight(1);

    // Inner Edge ring
    colors = setColorsArray(hueArray, division, inverted);
    setConicGradient(0, 0, 0, colors);
    if (!discoverSecret) ellipse(0, 0, size - stroke - 1, size - stroke - 1);

    // Outter Edge ring
    colors = setColorsArray(hueArray, division, !inverted);
    setConicGradient(0, 0, 0, colors);
    if (!discoverSecret) ellipse(0, 0, size + stroke + 1, size + stroke + 1);
    pop();
}
```
{{< /details >}}

Using this function we can draw the main circle ring, the inner and outer edge rings, the inner and outer edge rings are displaced a few degrees to the left and right respectively, this generates the illusion of movement in the viewer.

### Color induction ball

This color illusion induces a change in the color of the ball by moving it in a color gradient background, it consists of 2 main parts:

- A background with a linear gradient from dark to light in blue tones.
- A ball of intermediate color between the values at the ends of the gradient.

When we remove the gradient from the image, we see that in reality the ball does not change color as it seemed at first, but it is the same at all time.

{{< details "Special Keys" >}}
| Key              | Description    |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| F                | Remove gradient|
{{< /details >}}

{{<p5-iframe ver="1.4.2" sketch="/showcase/sketches/color_changing_ball.js" width="600" height="400" marginHeight="0" marginWidth="0" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no">}}

#### Code explanation
For the implementation we generate a rect with a linear gradient from dark to light in blue tones in the center of the canvas, then we draw the ball in the left of the canvas and we start moving it from left to right, when the ball reaches the right side of the canvas we start moving it from right to left.

{{< details "gradient and ball drawing">}}
```js
function draw() {
    background(171, 0, 80);

    getLinearGradient(
        -320, height / 2,
        width, height / 2,
        color(231, 100, 50, 100),
        color(188, 40, 100, 100)
    )

    if (!showSecret) rect(0, 0, 1200, 800, 0);

    printBall();
}
```

## Cornsweet illusion
This color illusion is generated when the eye is tricked to think of a 2D image as a 3D object, so the brain will try to apply previous knowledge of 3D objects to the image, this will generate a color distortion in the image.

It consists of 5 main parts:

- A blue rect in the center of the canvas filling the top half of the canvas.
- A brown rect in the center of the canvas filling the bottom half of the canvas.
- A gray shape in the center of the canvas simulating a 3D object.
- A dark brown shape under the gray shape simulating its shadow.
- A rect filled with a special gradient in the center of the gray shape simulating that there are two different shapes, one over the other instead of one.

When we remove the gradient from the image, we see that in reality the gray shape is the same at all time, but the brain is tricked to think that there are two different shapes, one over the other instead of one.

{{< hint info>}}
The trick is revealed when the canvas is clicked, so a rect with the same color as the shape is drawn over the mouse position, this will reveal the illusion.

## Coffee wall illusion
This geometric illusion is generated when the eye is tricked to think that the lines aren't parallel, so the brain will start seeing that the lines have a different angle, this will generate a geometric distortion in the image.

It consists of 2 main parts:

- A set of parallel lines spaced by a given height.
- A set of squares strip with the size of the height of the lines and separated by the same distance, each strip is moved a few pixels to the right or left generating an effect of a stair.

When we remove the squares from the image, we see that in reality the lines are parallel, but the brain is tricked to think that they aren't.

{{< details "Special Keys" >}}
| Key              | Description    |
| ---------------- | -------------- |

{{<p5-iframe ver="1.4.2" sketch="/showcase/sketches/stairs.js" width="600" height="350" marginHeight="0" marginWidth="0" frameBorder="0" scrolling="no">}}

#### Code explanation
For the implementation we set a given spacing size and we draw a set of parallel lines spaced by that size, then we draw a set of squares strip with the size of the height of the lines and separated by the same distance, each strip is moved a few pixels to the right or left using the modulo 3 operator, so the movement direction is inverted each 3 strips.

        // Print each square followed by a blank space
        printSquare(posX + (i * (2 * SQUARE_SIZE)) , posY, color)
    }
}

function printSquares(color){
    let strips_number = ceil(HEIGHT / SQUARE_SIZE);
    let translation = STRIP_MOVEMENT;

    for(let i = 0; i < strips_number; i++){
        printSquareStrip(SQUARE_SIZE / 2 + (translation * (i % STAIRS)), 
        SQUARE_SIZE * i + SQUARE_SIZE / 2,
        color);
        
        if (i % STAIRS == STAIRS - 1) translation = translation * -1;
    }

## Final thoughts
As we was abble to see, illusions are a great way to learn about how the brain works, and how it can be tricked to see things that aren't real, and how we can use this knowledge to create amazing distortions in reality, and with this knowledge we can interpret differently the things that are harder to understand, and we can also use this knowledge to create amazing effects for artistics and scientific purposes.
